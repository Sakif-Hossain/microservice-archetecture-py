# Video to Audio File Conversion Application

The project utilizes a microservice architecture, featuring a gateway service, authentication service, notification service, and conversion service. The gateway service serves as the entry point, routing user requests to the appropriate service.

To ensure scalability and efficient management of a large user base, I containerized the application using Docker and created multiple services with Kubernetes. For inter-service communication, I implemented RabbitMQ, facilitating efficient message passing between services.
